To simply use the .emacs file, copy it to your home directory. The .emacs is a hidden file under unix based machines so use `ls -a` to see it listed. 

The .emacs file uses many downloaded elisp files, which can be found under the "elisp" directory. For simplicity copy these files into "~/.emacs.d/auto-install" or place it any directory and edit the .emacs and it to the load-path.

A sample run of this process in freshly installed cygwin (this should work in other platforms too) is as follows:
$ git clone git@github.com:deepakantony/emacs_config.git
$ cp emacs_config/.emacs ~/
$ mkdir ~/.emacs.d/auto-install/
$ cp emacs_config/elisp/* ~/.emacs.d/auto-install/

Since this is the first time setting up emacs you might want to set up the latest emacs. If it is already installed rename it and them write a shell script to open the newly downloaded emacs.

Here is a sample run in cygwin:
$ which emacs
/usr/bin/emacs
$ mv /usr/bin/emacs /usr/bin/emacs.old
$ vi /usr/bin/emacs
#!/bin/bash
/cygdrive/c/emacs-24.1/bin/emacs.exe $1
$ chmod +x /usr/bin/emacs
